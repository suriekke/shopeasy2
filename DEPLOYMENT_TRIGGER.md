# Deployment Trigger

This file was created to trigger a new Render deployment with the updated configuration.

- render.yaml is now in the root directory
- Conflicting render.yaml files have been removed
- Backend directory structure is correct
- Package.json has all required scripts

Render should now use the correct configuration from the root render.yaml file.
